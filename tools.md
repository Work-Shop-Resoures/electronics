## What I Use

- **Software and Tools**
  - UNIX environment with command-line available
  - GitHub account configured for passwordless access
  - EastEDA for Web UI Board Design with connections to JLCPCB
  - KiCad for schematic capture and PCB layout
  - Eclipse for text-file editing, including software development
  - PDF datasheets and errata for each component used

- **Prototyping Tools**
  - Measuring calipers
  - Solderless breadboard and jumper wires for through-hole prototyping
  - Breakout boards for components only available as surface-mount
  - Development boards for various MCUs
  - Programmer/debugger interfaces (USB-to-SPI/IIC/USART/SWD/JTAG) for various MCUs

- **Soldering Equipment**
  - Temperature-controlled soldering iron
  - Flux-core solder on roll
  - Hot-air surface-mount-rework station
  - Solder paste
  - Flux
  - Desoldering braid (Solder Wick)
  - Spring-loaded syringe-type solder-sucker

- **Cleaning Supplies: In order of Least to Most Caustic, Respectively**
  - Isopropanol (a.k.a. isopropyl alcohol, IPA) or denatured alcohol (a.k.a. methylated spirit) for cleaning boards
  - Acetone (It is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) in certain concentrations, with low toxicity, but high flammability)
  - M.E.K. (Methyl Ethyl Ketone): Use with Caution as this is more caustic than acetone. Use gloves with this solvent.

- **Hand Tools**
  - Small long-nose pliers
  - Small diagonal cutters or sidecutters
  - Tweezers
  - Scalpel
  - Wire stripper
  - Kapton (heat-resistant film) adhesive tape

- **Magnification**
  - Magnifying glasses
  - Optical microscope
  - Electronic microscope

- **Test Equipment**
  - Power supply
  - Signal generator
  - Multimeter
  - Oscilloscope

- **Safety Equipment**
   - Gloves
