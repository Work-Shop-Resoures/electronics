# workflow
(not yet referenced from elsewhere)

## what I use

- UNIX environment with command-line available
- github account configured for passwordless access
- KiCad for schematic capture and PCB layout
- Eclipse for text-file editing including software development

- PDF datasheets and errata for each component used
- measuring calipers
- solderless breadboard and jumper wires for through-hole prototyping
- breakout boards for components only available as surface-mount
- development boards for various MCUs
- programmer/debugger interfaces (usually USB-to-SPI/IIC/USART/SWD/JTAG) for various MCUs
- temperature-controlled soldering iron
- flux-core solder on roll
- hot-air surface-mount-rework station
- solder paste
- flux
- desoldering braid
- spring-loaded syringe-type solder-sucker
- isopropanol a.k.a. isopropyl alcohol (IPA), or denatured alcohol a.k.a. methylated spirit, for cleaning boards
- small long-nose pliers
- small diagonal cutters or sidecutters
- tweezers
- scalpel
- wire stripper
- Kapton (heat-resistant film) adhesive tape

- magnifying glasses
- optical or electronic microscope

- power supply
- signal generator
- multimeter
- oscilloscope

## procedure

1 draw circuit schematic
2 draw planned outline of PCB
3 shuffle components into place, attempting to minimize "rat's nest" of connections
4 adjust size/shape of PCB if things don't fit; goto 3
5 select different components if things don't fit; goto 3
6 run copper tracks between components
7 adjust size/shape of PCB if things don't fit; goto 3
8 select different components if things don't fit; goto 3
